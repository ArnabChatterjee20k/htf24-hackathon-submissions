Team Members: Kunal Harinkhede
Project Title: MajorProject
Project Description: This project is related to the online marketplace, which enables users to upload their homes/villas on rent
for the short period of time for the tourist or peoples who wish to enjoy their vacation in such a amazing villas. In this project
there are two types of users one who upload his home on rent and other who book this home. 
Inspiration behind project: Inspiration behind project is that one of my relatives having such a amazing villas and they facing
problems regarding advertisement of their villas for the tourists then to solve such type of problems one idea had clicked on my
mind that we can developed such a type of website that helps peoples to upload their villas on rent and also other user who want
to book villas on rent.
Tech Stack: I have builded this by using MERN stack technology, that is i used expressjs, nodejs, and mongodb as a database. And
for frontend design i used BootStrap and Tailwind, for online storage of images of villas/houses i used cloudinary, and to show
the location on the web page of the villas/houses place i used mapbox. And for the simplicity to develope this website i used 
different packages. and finally for the deployment i used render service provider with free of cost.
Usage of Appwriter: I have not used any Appwriter product here.
