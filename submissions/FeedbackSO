# Hackathon Submission: FeedbackSO

## Project Title
FeedbackSO

## Project Description    
FeedbackSO is a feedback management platform with solution easily integrable to other sites, easy sharing , single management platform , imports
from other social-media and customisations.
With its single management dashboard, you can monitor, respond to, and manage all your feedback from one centralized location.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
For one of my SaaS I created feedback system and then again I created it for another app and then I came to know about this same problem from
others as well. So why not creating a single platform to manage all of these including social media imports.
Additionally I used for one of my community event and it works at peak.

## Tech Stack
The technologies I used are next.js, appwrite, trigger dot dev and vercel.
