Weather Mate is an intuitive weather forecasting application designed to provide users with accurate, real-time weather data, hourly and daily forecasts, and a 5-day outlook. Featuring light and dark modes, the app offers a clean, personalized interface for users to easily track weather updates and make day-to-day plans.

**Inspiration Behind the Project**  
Weather Mate was inspired by the need for an easy-to-use, visually appealing tool that delivers precise weather information. Our aim was to make a tool that serves as a reliable companion for weather updates, complete with features for personalizing location and theme to make users feel at home in the app.
