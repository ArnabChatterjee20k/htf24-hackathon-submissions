## Project Title
News-Web

## Project Description    

The project I created is a dynamic news website using React.js and Express.js. The website utilizes the Google News API to deliver a continuous stream of categorized news articles. Users can effortlessly scroll through the feed, eliminating the need for manual page refreshes. Additionally, the website incorporates a unique navbar where you can scroll through different categories of news such as Sports,Health etc. with just a click. News-Web caters to users who prefer a quick and readily available source of news updates.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
I've always been a news junkie. I love staying informed about the world around me, but it can be overwhelming to keep up with all the different sources and topics. That's why I decided to create News-Web, a personalized news platform designed to make it easy for people like me to stay informed.


Building News-Web was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about web development, user experience, and the importance of building a strong community. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and I'm excited to see where News-Web will go in the future.

I hope that News-Web will continue to be a valuable resource for people who want to stay informed and connected.
