PawCare is an innovative pet adoption and support platform designed to connect loving homes with needy pets. It provides a streamlined, user-friendly experience for adopting pets and addresses street animal concerns. Users can file complaints with location and contact details, enabling interested parties or communities to contact them within a week.

##  Project Inspiration
